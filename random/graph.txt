walk -> alt seq of vertices and edges
trail -> walk with no repeated edges
path -> walk with no repeated vertices
circuit : closed trail
cycle : closed path

eulerian trail : contains all edges > every internal vertex has even degree
mutligraph is eulerian if it has an Eulerian circuit

a multigraph G is bipartite iff G does not have an odd cycle

every loopless multigraph G has a bipartite subgraph of e(G)/2 edges
Every closed odd walk contains an odd cycle
