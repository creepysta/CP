1. given n, k
    1 <= n <= 10 ** 100000
    1 <= k <= 1e9
    remove a single digit from n and find max n % k

2. given n, k
    find distinct pairs (X,Y) [remove X digits from front, Y digits from end |
    given the remaining number has atleast 1 digit] such that n % k == 0

3. given a where 1 <= ai <= 9
    ans for q queries, 1 <= q <= 2*10**4
    given x, find smallest number >= k whose digits are in a
    1 <= x <= 2*10**4
